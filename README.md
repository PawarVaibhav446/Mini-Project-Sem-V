 Topic - Optimal charging station locator for electric vehicles.
 
Description: 
Currently, electric vehicle users are only provided with information about charging stations available near them. Still, they are not provided with information about which one to select in order to minimize the time required to reach their destination while taking into account the charging time. They are also not aware of the availability of these charging stations.
